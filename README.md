This is a webring of sites by people in the Mozilla Portland office. The
contained sites have themes including personal blogs, interesting side
projects, adorable pets, and silly demos.

Wikipedia describes a [webring]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) as "a
collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, and usually
organized around a specific theme."

Every site on the ring must include a navigation footer that links to its
neighbors in the ring. An embeddable page is provided for convenience.
